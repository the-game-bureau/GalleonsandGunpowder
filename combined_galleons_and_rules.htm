    <p>by TheGameBureau.com</p>

    <h2>🌊 Hoist the Sails for Adventure</h2>
    <p>Before ye begin, ensure ye have a worthy opponent who also holds a Skirmish Tracker, a pencil, pen, or highlighter, and a thirst for adventure. Both captains must be ready to clash, with their materials at the ready and their Sea Maps primed for battle!</p>

    <h2>🏴‍☠️ Glory or Oblivion!</h2>
    <p>Your mission, ye scurvy sea dog, is to send all of yer opponent's ships to Davy Jones' Locker before they send yers! Use one Skirmish Tracker to chart yer cannon fire and keep tabs on yer Armada's survival. Print two Skirmish Trackers: one for ye and one for yer treacherous foe!</p>

    <h2>🚢 The Armada</h2>
    <p>Each captain commands an Armada of five ships:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Galleon (5 squares): The mightiest ship in your Armada.</li>
        <li>Brigantine (4 squares): A sturdy and swift vessel.</li>
        <li>Frigate (3 squares): A versatile warship.</li>
        <li>Sloop (3 squares): Quick and reliable.</li>
        <li>Cutter (2 squares): The nimblest ship in the Armada.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📍 Place Your Ships</h2>
    <p>Place your ships:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secretly place your ships on your Sea Map:</li>
        <li>Use a pencil, pen, or highlighter to trace the outline of each ship. Keep yer secrets safe, or risk the enemy’s spyglass catching a glimpse!</li>
        <li>Ships may be placed horizontally or vertically but cannot overlap or extend off the grid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎯 Gameplay</h2>
    <h3>Taking Turns:</h3>
    <p>Decide who fires the first cannonball by flipping a coin, tossing a gold doubloon, or shouting “Arrr!” the loudest. The loudest pirate takes the first shot! Prove yer worth as the fiercest buccaneer on the seas!</p>

    <h3>Fire Your Cannons:</h3>
    <p>On your turn, announce a coordinate (e.g., "D6").</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your opponent checks their Sea Map:</li>
        <li>If ye hit a ship, they’ll cry out, “Arrrrrrrgh! Ye’ve struck true!”</li>
        <li>If ye miss, they’ll jeer, “Ha! Ye missed, ye scallywag!”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Track Your Shots:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a pencil, pen, or highlighter to mark your attacks:</li>
        <li>Mark hits with an “X.”</li>
        <li>Mark misses by shading or filling the circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sink a Ship:</h3>
    <p>When all squares of a ship are hit, your opponent must declare, “You sunk my [ship name]!” (e.g., "You sunk my Cutter!").</p>

    <h2>💰 Claiming the Treasure</h2>
    <p>The battle ends when one captain sinks all five enemy ships. That captain claims the title Dread Pirate of the High Seas! Celebrate yer victory with a mighty “Yo-ho-ho! Bring out the rum, lads! Let the grog flow and the shanties ring through the night!”</p>

    <p>The loser, alas, must walk the plank and join their shipmates in Davy Jones' Locker! Declare their defeat with a hearty "Overboard ye go! May the sharks sing tales of yer folly as ye descend to Davy Jones' Locker!"</p>

    <h2>⚓ Optional Rules for Extra Swashbuckling Fun</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Treasure Chest:</b> Each player may hide a single treasure chest (one square) on their grid. If hit, the attacker loses their next turn and must shout, "Ye found me booty, but no rum for ye this turn!"</li>
        <li><b>Hidden Fog:</b> Each player can declare one 2x2 section of their Sea Map as "fogged." The attacker must guess twice to confirm a hit in this area.</li>
        <li><b>The Kraken Strikes:</b> Once per game, each player can declare "Kraken!" and choose a 3x3 area of the opponent's Sea Map. The opponent must reveal whether any part of a ship is in that area, but no ship takes damage.</li>
        <li><b>Buried Treasure:</b> Each player can designate one square as "buried treasure." If the opponent hits it, they lose their next two turns as their crew digs for gold.</li>
        <li><b>Sabotage!:</b> Each player gets one chance per game to sabotage the enemy by calling out a coordinate where no shot is fired. Instead, the opponent must declare if they have a ship adjacent to that spot.</li>
        <li><b>Shifting Tides:</b> Before the game begins, each player may secretly "move" one ship one square in any direction without overlapping. This move is revealed only when a shot hits the ship in its new position.</li>
    </ul>
