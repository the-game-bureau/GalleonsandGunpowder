                <li><strong>Galleon</strong> (5 squares): The mightiest ship.</li>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>Taking Turns</h3>
            <p>Decide who fires the first cannonball by flipping a coin, tossing a gold doubloon, or shouting “Arrr!” the loudest. The loudest pirate takes the first shot!</p>

            <h3>Fire Your Cannons</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Announce a coordinate (e.g., "D6").</li>
                <li>Your opponent checks their Sea Map:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you hit a ship: they’ll cry out, “Arrrrrrrgh! Ye’ve struck true!”</li>
                        <li>If you miss: they’ll jeer, “Ha! Ye missed, ye scallywag!”</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Track Your Shots</h3>
            <p>Mark hits with an “X” and misses by shading or filling the circle on your Skirmish Tracker.</p>

            <h3>Sink a Ship</h3>
            <p>When all squares of a ship are hit, your opponent must declare, “You sunk my [ship name]!” (e.g., "You sunk my Cutter!").</p>

            <h2>&#x1F4B0; Claiming the Treasure</h2>
            <p>The loser, alas, must walk the plank and join their shipmates in Davy Jones' Locker! Declare their defeat with a hearty:</p>
            <blockquote>“Overboard ye go! May the sharks sing tales of yer folly as ye descend to Davy Jones' Locker!”</blockquote>

            <h2>⚓ Optional Rules for Extra Swashbuckling Fun</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Treasure Chest:</strong> Hide a treasure chest (1 square). If hit, the attacker loses their next turn and must shout, "Ye found me booty, but no rum for ye this turn!"</li>
                <li><strong>Hidden Fog:</strong> Declare one 2x2 section of your Sea Map as "fogged." The attacker must guess twice to confirm a hit in this area.</li>
                <li><strong>The Kraken Strikes:</strong> Once per game, declare "Kraken!" and choose a 3x3 area of your opponent’s Sea Map. They must reveal if any ship is there, but no ship takes damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Buried Treasure:</strong> Designate one square as "buried treasure." If hit, the attacker loses their next two turns.</li>
                <li><strong>Sabotage!:</strong> Call out a coordinate to disrupt your opponent by forcing them to declare if a ship is adjacent to the spot.</li>
                <li><strong>Shifting Tides:</strong> Before the game begins, secretly move one ship one square in any direction. This move is revealed only when the ship is hit.</li>
            </ul>
