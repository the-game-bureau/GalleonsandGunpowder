            <p>When all squares of a ship are hit, your opponent must declare, “You sunk my [ship name]!” (e.g., "You sunk my Cutter!").</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Buried Treasure:</strong> Designate one square as "buried treasure." If hit, the attacker loses their next two turns.</li>
                <li><strong>Sabotage!:</strong> Call out a coordinate to disrupt your opponent by forcing them to declare if a ship is adjacent to the spot.</li>

                <li><b>Buried Treasure:</b> Each player can designate one square as "buried treasure." If the opponent hits it, they lose their next two turns as their crew digs for gold.</li>
